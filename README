BluezMove is a "copy" of https://github.com/revned/proximity which can be used on Linux.
This project needs the following librairies to work :
	- libconfig
	- bluez

On Fedora you can install them easily with:
	yum install bluez-libs-devel libconfig libconfig-devel

Compilation:
	gcc main.c -lrt -lbluetooth -lconfig

When launching BluezMove for the first time, it will create an empty configuration file in $HOME/.bluezmove.
The default scanning delay is set to 20 seconds, it's harcored in the file, but will be add in config file soon.
