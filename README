BluezMove is a "copy" of https://github.com/revned/proximity which can be used on Linux.
This project needs the following librairies to work :
	- libconfig
	- bluez

On Fedora you can install them easily with:
	yum install bluez-libs-devel libconfig libconfig-devel

Compilation:
	gcc main.c -lrt -lbluetooth -lconfig

When launching BluezMove for the first time, it will create an empty configuration file in $HOME/.bluezmove.
The default scanning delay is set to 20 seconds, it's harcored in the file, but will be add in config file soon.

You can add as many Start and Stop scripts as you want, but they need to be set as executable (chmod +x).
The scripts could be python, ruby, C, bash, anything you want !

To add a script, just change the line as follow:
	Start = ["/home/user/start.py"]; -> Start = ["/home/user/start.py","/home/user/script1.rb"];
